yes can you provide a fully customized config with all these processors


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a fully customized Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector configuration that includes all the important processors for filtering, inserting, deleting, sampling, optimizing, and securing data.

🔹 Features Included:
✅ Traces: Filters unnecessary spans, samples traces, and converts spans into metrics.
✅ Metrics: Batches, optimizes memory, and enriches with metadata.
✅ Logs: Filters logs, masks PII, and routes logs based on attributes.
✅ Kubernetes Metadata: Automatically tags telemetry with pod, node, and namespace.
✅ Security & Compliance: Redacts sensitive information like API keys and user IDs.

🚀 How to Use This Configuration
Replace <your-splunk-realm> and <your-splunk-token> with your Splunk Observability details.

Deploy it in your OpenTelemetry Collector setup (otel-collector-config.yaml).

Validate with:

sh
Copy
Edit
otelcol --config otel-collector-config.yaml
Check Metrics via Prometheus (http://<collector-ip>:8889).

Monitor in Splunk Observability 🚀.

📌 Key Enhancements in This Configuration
✔ Filter out unwanted debug logs & internal services
✔ Mask sensitive information like API keys & PII
✔ Sample intelligently (keep only 20% of traces)
✔ Batch & optimize network traffic
✔ Tag telemetry with cloud & Kubernetes metadata
✔ Convert traces to metrics for Prometheus
✔ Route logs & metrics dynamically
