can I have multiple agent-config.yml for the splunk otel collector so that I can put my additional processors as required in new additional-agent-config.yml


ChatGPT said:
Yes, you can use multiple configuration files for the Splunk OpenTelemetry (Otel) Collector by using the --config or --config-file flag when starting the collector.

How to Use Multiple Config Files
Primary Config File (e.g., agent-config.yml)

This will be your main configuration file that contains the base setup.

Additional Config File (e.g., additional-agent-config.yml)

This file contains extra processors, extensions, or exporters that you want to apply separately.

Combining Multiple Configs
You can merge multiple config files by passing them in order to the OpenTelemetry Collector:

sh
Copy
Edit
otelcol --config agent-config.yml --config additional-agent-config.yml
OR if using Docker:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -v "$(pwd)/config:/etc/otel" \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector \
  --config /etc/otel/agent-config.yml \
  --config /etc/otel/additional-agent-config.yml
Example Configs
agent-config.yml (Main Config)

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "https://ingest.signalfx.com"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
additional-agent-config.yml (Extra Config)
yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  attributes:
    actions:
      - key: environment
        value: "production"
        action: insert

  filter:
    traces:
      exclude:
        match_type: regexp
        services: ["internal-*"]

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      processors: [attributes, filter]
Why Use Multiple Configs?
‚úÖ Easier modularity‚Äîyou can manage customizations separately.
‚úÖ Helps with environment-based changes (e.g., different processors for Dev vs. Prod).
‚úÖ Avoids messy large config files, making debugging easier.

  Here are some additional processors you can add to your Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector configuration. These processors will help with filtering, attribute enrichment, sampling, and security.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Resource Processor

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: environment
        value: "production"
        action: insert
      - key: cloud.provider
        value: "AWS"
        action: upsert
2Ô∏è‚É£ Attributes Processor
üîπ Use case: Modify span attributes dynamically (e.g., masking PII data).

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  attributes:
    actions:
      - key: user.id
        action: delete  # Remove sensitive user ID
      - key: http.method
        action: update
        value: "POST"  # Normalize HTTP methods
3Ô∏è‚É£ Filter Processor
üîπ Use case: Drop traces or logs based on rules (e.g., exclude internal services).

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  filter:
    traces:
      exclude:
        match_type: regexp
        services: ["internal-*"]  # Exclude all internal services
4Ô∏è‚É£ Probabilistic Sampler
üîπ Use case: Sample only 10% of traces to reduce data volume.

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 10.0
5Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Limiter Processor
üîπ Use case: Prevents OTel Collector from consuming too much memory.

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_percentage: 75
    spike_limit_percentage: 20
6Ô∏è‚É£ Span Metrics Processor
üîπ Use case: Converts trace spans into metrics for easier monitoring in Grafana.

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  spanmetrics:
    metrics_exporter: prometheus
    dimensions:
      - name: http.status_code
      - name: service.name
7Ô∏è‚É£ Tail Sampling Processor
üîπ Use case: Keeps only important traces based on conditions (e.g., errors).

yaml
Copy
Edit
processors:
  tailsampling:
    decision_wait: 10s
    policies:
      - name: error_traces
        type: status_code
        status_code: { status_classes: [5xx] }  # Keep only HTTP 5xx errors
How to Use These Processors
Add processors to your additional-agent-config.yml.

Reference them in your pipeline like this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch, attributes, filter, probabilistic_sampler, spanmetrics, tailsampling]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
